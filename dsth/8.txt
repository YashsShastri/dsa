Here is the explanation of the code and logic with comments to make it easier to understand:

### Code Explanation:

This is a C++ program that implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** to store and manage a simple dictionary, where each node contains a keyword and its meaning. The program supports **Insert**, **Delete**, **Modify**, and **Display** operations. The tree is balanced using **AVL tree rotations** to maintain its height-balanced property, ensuring that operations are performed in logarithmic time.

### Class `Node`:

The `Node` structure is used to represent each entry in the binary search tree.

* **keyword**: The word (string) which is the key for searching.
* **meaning**: The meaning of the keyword.
* **lchild**: Pointer to the left child node.
* **rchild**: Pointer to the right child node.
* **height**: The height of the node, used for balancing the tree.

The `Node` class has two constructors:

1. Default constructor initializes the node with empty strings and nullptr pointers.
2. Parameterized constructor initializes the node with the keyword, meaning, and sets the height to 1.

### Class `BinarySearchTree`:

This class manages the BST operations and AVL tree balancing:

* **root**: A pointer to the root node of the tree.
* \**getHeight(Node*)\*\*: Returns the height of a node. If the node is `nullptr`, the height is 0.
* \**getBalanceFactor(Node*)\*\*: Returns the balance factor (difference between left and right child heights). It helps in determining if the tree is balanced or needs rotation.
* \**insert(Node*, char\[], char\[])\*\*: Inserts a new node into the tree. It ensures the tree remains balanced by checking the balance factor after each insertion and performing rotations as necessary (left or right rotation).
* \**inorder(Node*)\*\*: Performs an in-order traversal of the tree and displays the nodes' keywords, meanings, and heights.
* **modify(char\[], char\[])**: Searches for a node with a given keyword and modifies its meaning if found.
* \**deleteNode(Node*, char\[])\*\*: Deletes a node with the specified keyword. It ensures the tree remains balanced after deletion.
* \**rotateRight(Node*)\*\*: Right rotation to balance the tree when the left subtree is too deep.
* \**rotateLeft(Node*)\*\*: Left rotation to balance the tree when the right subtree is too deep.
* \**getPredecessor(Node*)\*\*: Returns the predecessor node for the deletion operation (in case the node to be deleted has two children).

### Main Program Flow:

* The program runs in a loop where the user can select different options:

  1. **Insert Data**: Allows the user to insert a keyword and its meaning into the tree.
  2. **Display Data**: Displays the current data (all nodes in the tree).
  3. **Modify Data**: Allows the user to update the meaning of a keyword.
  4. **Delete Data**: Allows the user to delete a keyword from the tree.
  5. **Exit**: Terminates the program.

### Detailed Logic:

1. **Insert Data**:

   * The `insert()` function inserts a new keyword into the tree, comparing it lexicographically with the existing nodes.
   * After inserting, the height of the nodes is updated, and the balance factor is checked. If the tree becomes unbalanced (balance factor is greater than 1 or less than -1), rotations (right or left) are performed to restore balance.

2. **Modify Data**:

   * The `modify()` function finds the node with the specified keyword and updates its meaning.
   * If the node is not found, it prints "Node not found".

3. **Delete Data**:

   * The `deleteNode()` function first finds the node to be deleted.
   * If the node has two children, the right subtree's predecessor is used to replace the node.
   * The tree is then rebalanced using the same rotation mechanism after the deletion.

4. **Balance the Tree**:

   * After every insertion and deletion, the tree checks if it is unbalanced. If it is, the tree performs a rotation (left or right) to restore balance. This ensures that the tree remains balanced for optimal performance during search, insertion, and deletion.

5. **Display Data**:

   * The `inorder()` function traverses the tree in in-order fashion, which visits the nodes in lexicographical order (left subtree, current node, right subtree).

### Sample Output Walkthrough:

1. **Insertion**:

   * Let's say the user inserts the word "apple" with the meaning "A fruit".
   * After inserting, the tree will be checked for balance. If any node becomes unbalanced, a rotation will occur to restore balance.

2. **Modification**:

   * If the user wants to change the meaning of the word "apple", they can input the new meaning, and the program will update it.

3. **Deletion**:

   * If the user decides to delete a word like "apple", the program finds the node and removes it. If necessary, the tree will rebalance itself.

4. **Displaying Data**:

   * After each operation, the current state of the tree is displayed using in-order traversal.

### Code Example with Comments:

```cpp
// Insert Data operation
case 1:
    cout << "Enter Keyword : ";
    cin.getline(keyy, 20);  // User input for keyword
    cout << "Enter Meaning : ";
    cin.getline(meaning, 40);  // User input for meaning
    bst.root = bst.insert(bst.root, keyy, meaning);  // Insert into BST
    bst.inorder(bst.root);  // Display the tree in inorder
    break;

// Modify Data operation
case 3:
    cout << "Enter Keyword     : ";
    cin.getline(keyy, 20);  // Input the keyword to modify
    cout << "Enter New Meaning : ";
    cin.getline(new_meaning, 40);  // Input the new meaning
    bst.modify(keyy, new_meaning);  // Modify the meaning
    bst.inorder(bst.root);  // Display updated tree
    break;
```

This is the flow of how the operations work step by step. The program allows the user to interact with a dictionary stored in a binary search tree while ensuring the tree remains balanced and efficient for searching and modifying data.
