Perfect Yash! Youâ€™ve uploaded a well-structured code for **Generalized Linked List (GLL)** â€” a very important concept for **SPPU DSA practicals (2019 Pattern)**.

## âœ… Objective of Code:

To implement a **Generalized Linked List (GLL)** to store a **Book** â†’ **Section** â†’ **Subsection** structure using **linked nodes**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ FULL COMMENTED CODE + LOGIC EXPLANATION

### ðŸ”¸ Node Structure

```cpp
struct Node {
	int flag;           // Flag = 0 means no child, 1 means has a down link (sections/subsections)
	char title[30];     // Stores title (book/section/subsection)
	Node* down;         // Points to next level (section/subsection)
	Node* next;         // Points to next node at same level (sibling)

	Node() {
		flag = 0;
		strcpy(title, "");
		down = nullptr;
		next = nullptr;
	}

	Node(char titl[]) {
		flag = 0;
		strcpy(title, titl);
		down = nullptr;
		next = nullptr;
	}
};
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ GLL Class and Constructor

```cpp
class GeneralizedLinkedList {
	private:
		Node *root;  // root points to the Book node

	public:
		GeneralizedLinkedList(char titl[30]) {
			root = new Node(titl);  // create book title
		}
```

### ðŸ”¸ Get Book Title and Find Section

```cpp
	char* getTitle() {
		return root->title;  // return book name
	}

	Node* getSection(char titl[30]) {
		Node *temp = root->down;  // move to first section
		while(temp != NULL) {
			if(strcmp(temp->title, titl) == 0)
				return temp;
			temp = temp->next;
		}
		return NULL;  // section not found
	}
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ Create Node (for book/section/subsection)

```cpp
	Node* create_node(string title) {
		char titl[30];
		cout << "Enter " << title << " Title: ";
		cin.getline(titl, 30);
		Node *newnode = new Node(titl);
		return newnode;
	}
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ Add Section or Subsection

```cpp
	void add_section(Node *section_root = NULL) {
		string titlee;
		if(section_root == NULL && root == NULL) {
			cout << "Not Found";
			return;
		}

		// section_root is book or a section
		section_root = (section_root == NULL) ? root : section_root;
		titlee = (section_root == root) ? "Section" : "SubSection";

		Node *sect = create_node(titlee);

		if(section_root->flag == 0) {
			section_root->down = sect;  // first section or subsection
			section_root->flag = 1;
		}
		else {
			Node *temp = section_root->down;
			while(temp->next != nullptr)
				temp = temp->next;
			temp->next = sect;  // attach at end
		}
		cout << "Successfully Added." << endl;
	}
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ Display the entire Book â†’ Section â†’ Subsection structure

```cpp
	void display() {
		Node *temp = root;
		Node *subsection;
		Node *section;
		cout << "\nTitle = " << temp->title <<endl;
		section = temp->down;
		while(section != NULL) {
			cout << "\tSection = " << section->title << endl;
			subsection = section->down; 
			while(subsection != NULL) {
				cout << "\t\tSubsection = " << subsection->title << endl;
				subsection = subsection->next;
			}				
			section = section->next;
		}	
	}
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ `main()` Menu (Create, Add, Display)

```cpp
GeneralizedLinkedList *gl[10] = {nullptr};  // store 10 books max
int index = 0;  // track number of books
```

---

## ðŸ§  LOGIC SUMMARY

* Each book is the **root node**.
* Each book has multiple **sections** â†’ stored in `down` pointer.
* Each section can have multiple **subsections** â†’ also via `down`, siblings via `next`.
* The **flag** indicates if a node has a child (section/subsection).

## ðŸŽ¤ VIVA QUESTIONS (With Answers)

### Q1. What is a Generalized Linked List (GLL)?

**Ans:** A GLL is a type of linked list where each node can either store a data element or a pointer to another list (i.e., hierarchical or nested structure).

---

### Q2. What does the `flag` field do?

**Ans:** It indicates whether a node has a `down` pointer:

* `flag = 0` â†’ no child
* `flag = 1` â†’ has sections/subsections

---

### Q3. Difference between `down` and `next` pointer?

* **down**: points to child (section/subsection)
* **next**: points to sibling (next section or subsection)

---

### Q4. Can a node have both `down` and `next` pointers?

**Ans:** Yes. `down` leads to nested level; `next` moves on same level.

---

### Q5. What is the purpose of using `cin.ignore()`?

**Ans:** To flush the newline character `\n` left in the input buffer after `cin`, before using `getline()`.

---

### Q6. Why do we use `char title[30]` instead of `string`?

**Ans:** To comply with C-style string handling for compatibility with functions like `strcpy` and `strcmp`.

---

### Q7. How is subsection added?

**Ans:** By first finding the section using `getSection()` and then calling `add_section(section_node)`.

---

### Q8. What if book title already exists?

**Ans:** This code allows duplicate book titles, but ideally a check should be added.

---

### Q9. Is this recursive structure?

**Ans:** No, itâ€™s **iterative**, but GLL supports recursion conceptually.

---

### Q10. What is the output of the display function?

**Ans:** It prints:

```
Title = <Book>
    Section = <Section>
        Subsection = <Subsection>
```

---

## ðŸ“˜ Sample Execution Summary

```
Create Book       â†’ "Harry Potter"
Add Section       â†’ "Phase-1", "Phase-2"
Add Subsection    â†’ Under "Phase-1" â†’ "Introduction"
Display Structure
```

Expected Output:

```
Title = Harry Potter
    Section = Phase-1
        Subsection = Introduction
    Section = Phase-2
```
